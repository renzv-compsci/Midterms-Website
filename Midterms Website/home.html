                <p>
                    The page no longer haunts my hand,<br>
                    Its white expanse, a promised land.<br>
                    With every stroke, I breathe in deep,<br>
                    No fear to wake, no doubt to keep.<br><br>
                    
                    My heart now races, not from fear,<br>
                    But from the joy of what draws near.<br>
                    Each line, a dance, unchained, untamed,<br>
                    A city born, its beauty claimed.<br><br>
                    
                    The world, it bends beneath my view,<br>
                    A canvas wide, in shades of blue.<br>
                    No longer bound by perfect form,<br>
                    I sketch with ease, in passion's storm.<br><br>
                    
                    An artist’s eye, I now embrace,<br>
                    Each crooked line, each empty space.<br>
                    For in the flaws, I see the grace—<br>
                    A city’s soul, in every trace.

                <h1>Lines of Fear, Shades of Growth</h1>
                <p>
                    At first, the page was vast and cold,<br>
                    My hands unsure, the pen too bold.<br>
                    A city’s edge, a daunting sight,<br>
                    My heart, it trembled in the light.<br><br>
                    
                    Each stroke, a whisper of my doubt,<br>
                    The fear within, I traced it out.<br>
                    Yet as the ink began to flow,<br>
                    The city’s soul began to show.<br><br>
                    
                    With every line, the fear would fade,<br>
                    A world from shadows I had made.<br>
                    Now, what was once a timid start,<br>
                    Has grown to fill a cornered heart.<br><br>
                    
                    And every day, I sketch anew,<br>
                    The love for this—the lines I drew.<br>
                    No longer bound by anxious ties,<br>
                    I see the world through artist’s eyes.

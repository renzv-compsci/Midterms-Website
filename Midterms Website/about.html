                <p>
                    Hi! I'm Renz Jerik C. Viloria, a passionate Computer Science student with a focus on Machine Learning. Currently, I'm Secretary in the Organization of NU Wizards Circle and working on my Personal projects. I love exploring new things and life, such as hobbies and my other interests and I am always eager to learn new things.

                    My journey started when I was a kid, I grew a fond relationship with technology and games, and since then, I have developed skills in Computer literacy, Game mechanics, Creativity, Collaboration, and many more. I enjoy solving challenges and pushing my boundaries.
                    
                    When I'm not working, you can find me sleeping, gaming, or reading a book. I'm always looking to connect and collaborate, so feel free to reach out!
